    "# DataMop Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the tutorial for `DataMop`, the ultimate Python package for cleaning and preparing your datasets with minimal effort. Data cleaning can often feel like the most tedious part of any data analysis or machine learning project. Missing values, inconsistent scales, and different data types can slow you down and distract from the real task: extracting insights from your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where `DataMop` package comes in! This powerful, easy-to-use package automates many of the common data cleaning tasks, like imputing missing values, encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features, saving you time and effort while ensuring your data is consistent, complete, and ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will show example usages for each function in the package, including `sweep_nulls`, `column_encoder`, and `column_scaler`. Your messy data will be ready to use after using this robust package. With `DataMop`, you can focus more on analysis and less on tedious preprocessing. "
